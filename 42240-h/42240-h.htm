<p><a name = "start" id = "start">This text</a> uses UTF-8 (Unicode)
file encoding. If the apostrophes and quotation marks in this paragraph
appear as garbage, you may have an incompatible browser or unavailable

default font.</p>

<p>The Gairdner edition of the Paston Letters was printed in six
volumes.
Each volume is a separate e-text; Volume VI is further divided into two
e-texts, Letters and Index. Volume&nbsp;I, the General Introduction,
will be released after all other volumes, matching the original
publication order.</p>

<p>All brackets are in the original, as are parenthetical question marks
and (<i>sic</i>) notations. Series of dots representing damaged text are
shown as printed. Note that the printed book used <b>z</b> to represent
original yogh <b>ȝ</b>. This has not been changed for the e-text. The
copy number (first page of each volume) is hand-written.</p>

<p>The year of each letter was printed in a sidenote at the top of the
page; this has been merged with the sidenote at the beginning of each
letter. Footnotes have their original numbering, with added page number
to make them usable with the full Index. They are grouped at the end of
each Letter or Abstract.</p>

<p><ins class = "correction" title ="like this">Text lightly shaded in
violet</ins> indicates the site of a typographical error. Hover the
cursor over the shaded text, and the explanation should appear.
Typographical errors are listed again at the end of the Letter,
after any footnotes. In the primary text, errors were only
corrected if they are clearly editorial, such as missing italics, or
mechanical, such as <span class = "locked">u-for-n</span> misprints.
Italic “d” misprinted as “a” was a recurring problem. The word
“invisible” means that there is an appropriately sized blank space, but
the letter or punctuation mark itself is missing.</p>

<p><i>Some Specifics:</i> The spelling “Jhon” is not an error. Gresham
and Tresham are different people. Conversely, the inconsistent spelling
of the name “Lipyate” or “Lipgate” in footnotes is unchanged.</p>

Agnes Paston, grandmother to Sir John, presented Thomas Everard to the
Rectory of Oxnead in 1475, and in 1479, she again presented William
Barthulmew, so that the Duke of Suffolk either did not attempt to
disturb her right; or at least did not succeed, if he endeavoured to do
it.&mdash;F. It will be seen by No. 935 that before presenting William
Barthulmew she presented Dr. Richard Lyncoln.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] William
Paston, the writer of this letter, was a younger son of old John Paston,
and brother of the John Paston to whom the letter is addressed. He was
born, as Fenn tells us, in 1459, and it will be seen by what is said of
him in Letter 842 that he could not possibly be older. He was now at
Eton finishing his education, and we have a letter from him written
there on the 23rd of February 1479, which gives good reason for
attributing this to the November immediately before.</p>

Fenn reads ‘ffoodyd ne,’ and in the modern copy ‘fooded not forth,’ of
which some fanciful explanations are suggested in a footnote. The true
reading ought certainly to be ‘me’ and not ‘ne,’ the meaning evidently
being ‘he has put me off ever since.’ ‘To fode out with words’ is an
expression which, as Halliwell informs us, occurs in Skelton,
Harrington, etc.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] As this
letter refers to the making of a tombstone for Sir John Paston, it may
be presumed to have been written either at the end of the year 1479, or
in the course of the year 1480. The <span class =

Edmund Paston. It has been slightly mutilated, and apparently since the

[From Fenn, iii. 400.] On the date of this letter Fenn remarks as
follows:&mdash;‘John Titleshale was prior of Bromholm from 1460 for
about twenty years. This letter must have been written therefore either
on the 14th October 1460, or on the same day in 1465, as Edward <span
class = "smallroman">IV.</span> married in that year, and J. Paston died
in May 1466. If it was written in the former, the request [for timber]
must have been to Queen Margaret; if in the latter, to Elizabeth, the
Queen of Edward <span class = "smallroman">IV.</span>’ In these
observations Fenn overlooks the possibility of the letter having been
addressed to any other John Paston than the first of that name; and
neither of the two years, which alone suit that supposition, has much
internal probability. It is inconceivable that the letter could have
been written in 1460, when Queen Margaret had retired into Wales after
the battle of Northampton, and it is almost equally improbable that the
date could have been 1465, when John Paston, the father, was in prison.
We have very little doubt that the letter was addressed to John Paston
the youngest, called of Gelston, long after his father’s death, and
after that of his brother Sir John also. John Tytleshale, who was Prior
of Bromholm in 1460, was succeeded, at what date we are not informed, by
John Macham; and after him John Underwood, Bishop of Chalcedon,
suffragan of the Bishop of Norwich, was prior in 1509. The date of this
letter, however, must lie between 1480 and 1487, in which latter year
<!-- the name John was banned for causing pandemic confusion --> John
Paston the youngest was created a knight for his services at the battle
of Stoke.</p>

nothing to show the date of this letter, except the fact that William
Paston did not come of age before the year 1481, so that it is not
likely to be earlier. Perhaps it may be a few years later, in which case
the widow would not have been very much his senior; but that
circumstance was not likely, in those days, to have been greatly

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] Fenn dates
this letter 1479-80, suggesting that it must have been written very soon
after Edmund Paston’s marriage with the widow of William Clippesby, as
it seems to imply that he had not yet carried his bride to pay her duty
to his mother. I&nbsp;do not, for my part, know the date of this
marriage, and I suspect Fenn had no other clue to it than the fact that
William Clippesby, the lady’s first husband, died on the 24th September
1479; but I presume his widow was still unmarried when she proved his
will on the 18th May 1480 (<i>see</i> Blomefield, xi. 144).
I&nbsp;consider, therefore, that the letter must have been written
between the years 1481 and 1484, as Margaret Paston died in November of
the latter year.</p>

<i>Ibid.</i> This letter, it will be seen, must have been written before
the death of Margaret Paston in 1484, and from what is stated in <a href
= "#letter953">No.&nbsp;953</a>, it is certainly not earlier than 1479.
The date, moreover, must be between 1480 and 1482, for it is stated that
the outrages here complained of occurred on the Monday and Tuesday
before the letter was written; and in the next letter we find that there
was a new outrage of the same description on Friday. If Hallowmas Day,
the date of this letter, was a Wednesday, the year must be 1480, if a
Thursday 1481, and if Friday 1482. We are rather inclined to think it
was the latter.</p>

death of William Worcester, and perhaps after that of William Paston
also. The exact date of Worcester’s death is uncertain. We only know
that he was alive as late as 1480, when he visited Oxford on his travels
and measured some of the churches there (<i>see</i> his
<i>Itinerarium</i>, 296), and that he was dead in Richard <span class =

side towards the end. The seals of William Barker and Margaret Worcester
are attached by tails of parchment to a parchment binding at the bottom.

[From Fenn, ii. 300.] This is a catalogue of the books either of John
Paston the younger or of John Paston, Knight, most probably the former,
drawn up in the reign of Edward <span class = "smallroman">IV.</span>,
but owing to the decay of the original <span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span> we cannot tell in what year. It certainly could
not have been earlier than 1475, when <i>The Game and Play of the
Chess</i> was first printed by Caxton. It is in itself a remarkable
thing that the expression ‘in print’ should have got into use even
during the reign of Edward <span class = "smallroman">IV.</span>; but
one may suppose that such an expression could hardly have been current
for at least a year or two after the first printed book appeared. We
therefore, without deciding the year, place the paper at the end of King
Edward’s reign.</p>

the Countess of Oxford to her husband after he escaped abroad in 1471

of Lydgate writing in the name of a lady parted from her lord. We place

[From Fenn, v. 302.] This letter was not a part of the Paston
correspondence, but was printed by Fenn in the series as a letter of
much historical interest from a copy given him by the Rev. John Brand,
secretary to the Society of Antiquaries. The following memoranda
accompanied the copy:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Extract from an ancient <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> of
pedigrees, etc., in quarto, late in the possession of Sir Walter
Blackett, Bart., and now the property of John Erasmus Blackett, Esq.,
Alderman of Newcastle-upon-Tyne; p. 333, under title of “<i>A Coppie of
some Letters which were found in Rabie Castle after the Rebellion, to
shew the fashion<span class = "enspace">&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
.&nbsp;</span>of those times</i>.” The above <span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span> is of the date of James <span class =
"smallroman">I.</span>, though there are several continuations in a more
modern hand.</p>

<p>‘This copy has doubtless been a transcript of an original letter of
the Duke of Gloucester, afterwards King Richard <span class =
"smallroman">III.</span>, and written just before his seizure of the
crown.</p>

<p>‘Raby Castle is in the county of Durham.’</p>

<p>Fenn adds that it does not appear clearly who this Lord Nevill was.
But as the letter was found in Raby Castle after the great rebellion of
the Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland, in 1569, it was evidently
addressed to one of that family of Nevills, the heads of which were
Earls of Westmoreland. In 1483 the Earl of Westmoreland’s name was Ralph
Nevill, but he died in the year following, and was succeeded in the
title by Ralph, son and heir of his brother, John, Lord Nevill, who was
slain at Towton. It was this Ralph, then heir-presumptive to the
earldom, who is here called Lord Nevill. He had got his father’s
attainder reversed in 1472, and his title of Lord Nevill was recognised.

[From Fenn, ii. 292.] This is a holograph letter of Elizabeth, Duchess
of Suffolk, the sister of Edward <span class = "smallroman">IV.</span>
There can be little doubt that the Lord Chamberlain referred to is the
Lord Hastings who has been very frequently mentioned in this
correspondence; and if so, the letter cannot be later than 1483, as he
was beheaded in that year on the 13th June, by order of the Protector
Richard, Duke of Gloucester. We may therefore place it for convenience
among the letters of Edward <span class = "smallroman">V.</span>’s time,
though undoubtedly it may be a few years earlier. Facsimiles of the
original, both back and front, are given by Fenn. It is endorsed in the
hand of John Paston, the younger (certainly not in that of his brother
Sir John, as Fenn supposed)&mdash;‘Littra Ducisse Suff.’</p>

[From Fenn, ii. 314.] Sir John Howard was created Duke of Norfolk on the
28th June 1483, and was killed in the battle of Bosworth on the 22nd
August 1485. This letter seems to have been written in October 1483,
when it first became known that a series of insurrections were about to
take place in different counties, of which the Duke of Buckingham was
the principal leader. It was on the 12th October, just two days after
this letter was written, that King Richard himself at Lincoln heard of
Buckingham’s intended treason.</p>

[From Fenn, ii. 330.] Fenn supposes with great probability that this
letter was written in 1484, the year of Margaret Paston’s death. No
earlier date is possible, seeing that even in 1484 John Paston’s eldest
son was only in his seventh year, and he had at the date of this letter
two sons capable of being sent on messages; so that, if anything, we
should be inclined to put it later. But we know of no later death in the
family that could have occasioned the writing of such a letter, and the
time of Margaret Paston’s death and of the proving of her will agree
very well with Fenn’s hypothesis. From the calendar prefixed to an old
<span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> missal in the possession of the
late Mr. C.&nbsp;W. Reynell, I&nbsp;found that she died on the 4th
November 1484. Her will was proved at Norwich on the 18th December
following.</p>

Sir Miles Stapleton died in 1466. His widow Catherine seems to have

Huntingfeld, in Norf.,<a class = "tag" name = "tag80_1" id = "tag80_1"
href = "#note80_1">80.1</a> but I claim this manor by my mother’s gift.
‘This manor is but a mile from Clopton’s and not far from Smalbrigge,
where your Grace is now.’ John Barell is farmer of this manor, who, when
I came to your Grace just after my mother’s death, confessed before your
servants, Piers Rumbold and William Smyth, that he was privy of mine
estate in my mother’s days, and took the farm of me at that time.
‘Madam, this is the man ye sent your servant W. Smyth to, for to keep
the possession there; and after he had tarried there awhile he took a
promise of the farmer that he should pay no money to nobody without
commandment from your Grace; contrary to which promise, by the favour of
some folks that your Grace can deem, he hath paid my nephew a £10 or
£20.’ I think, Madam, you need send no man to keep possession there; but
your Grace might send a servant thither to show the tenants your
displeasure, inasmuch as he hath broken his promise with your Grace, and
threaten to distrain.</p>

manor of Weston Baldok<a class = "tag" name = "tag80_2" id = "tag80_2"

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] This is a
paper of notes relating to the manors of Stansted in Suffolk and
Harwellbury in Herts, addressed to a lady who is styled ‘Madam’ and
‘your Grace,’ and who, though not named, was undoubtedly the Duchess of
Norfolk. Compare <a href = "#letter962">No.&nbsp;962</a>. The writer is
perhaps John Paston of Gelston; in which case the date must be after
1484, as he speaks of his mother as being dead. More probably it was his
uncle William, and John Paston is the nephew referred to in the paper
itself. But even in that case the document cannot be five years earlier,
as Agnes Paston died in 1479.</p>

been issued on the 7th December 1484, of which a copy will also be found
in the same Harleian volume at folio 273 b. Sir Henry Ellis has also
printed in his <i>Original Letters</i> (2 Ser. i. 162) a copy of this
proclamation as set forth in the original warrant for issuing it, which
the King addressed to the Bishop of Lincoln as Chancellor. The <span

different texts throughout with that printed by Fenn, and noted all

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] This letter
must have been written either in 1485 or in 1486. Thomas Howard, Earl of
Surrey, was taken prisoner at the battle of Bosworth on the 22nd August
1485, and was not released from confinement till 1487, in which latter
year also John Paston, to whom this letter is addressed, was knighted at
the battle of Stoke on the 16th June. Most likely the letter is of the
year 1485, at the beginning of the Earl’s imprisonment, and when Henry

[From Fenn, ii. 336.] There is a difficulty in dating this letter only
from the address being to Sir John Paston. It has every appearance of
having been written in the year 1486, when Francis, Viscount Lovel, lay
concealed shortly before his outbreak with Humphrey and Thomas Stafford.
But in that case the prefix ‘Sir’ before John Paston’s name must not be
taken as indicating that he was then a knight; for he was not knighted
till the battle of Stoke in June 1487.</p>

<p>The writer of this letter was the widow of Henry, Lord Fitzhugh, who
died on the 12th June 1472. She was the daughter of Richard Nevill, Earl
of Salisbury, and sister of Warwick the Kingmaker.</p>

[From Fenn, ii. 338.] The date of this is quite certain from the subject
to which it refers, as well as from the fact of John Paston being at the
time Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk. Francis, Viscount Lovel, was one of
the principal adherents of Richard <span class =
"smallroman">III.</span>, and was attainted after the accession of Henry
<span class = "smallroman">VII.</span> in 1485. For some time he lay
concealed, but in the spring of 1486 he attempted to raise an
insurrection along with Humphrey and Thomas Stafford, who had broken out
of their sanctuary at Colchester. He is said to have been drowned in the
Trent in 1487, in endeavouring to escape after the battle of Stoke. But
according to another story he lived in concealment for some time
after.</p>

[From Douce <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> 393, f. 78.] Francis,
Viscount Lovel, after trying to raise a rebellion in England in 1486,
escaped abroad to Flanders, and joined the Earl of Lincoln in the
following spring in an invasion of England in behalf of Lambert Simnel.
This letter appears therefore to have been written in the beginning of

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] The writer of
this letter was John Bonwell, who was made Prior of Norwich in 1480, and
died in 1488. As it is actually dated in the second year of Henry <span
class = "smallroman">VII.</span>, it must have been written either after
the 22nd August in 1486 or before that date in 1487. Most probably it is
of the latter year. It is endorsed in a contemporaneous
hand&mdash;‘Billa Prioris Norwic’ pro missa perpetue fundanda.’ One or
two words are now lost by the decay of the paper, which seem to have
been visible in the text when Fenn copied the <span class =

[Add. <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> 34,889, f. 135.] This is
only a fragment, the first part of which is lost. The seven names at the
beginning are the end of a list of knights bannerets made upon the
field. Then follow the names of those who were merely dubbed knights;
but this list, too, is imperfect, not merely by the mutilation of some
names, but because another leaf would certainly have been required to
give them all. Compare another copy of these lists in Leland’s
<i>Collectanea</i>, iv. 214-15, where the names in the second list stand
in a different order. Several of the mutilated names here have been

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] The date of
this letter is nearly as indefinite as that of the last, but it
certainly lies between the year 1487, when Sir John Paston was knighted,
and 1489, when William Brews died. If the latter part of the letter
refers to the levying of a subsidy, in which the Bishop of Chester may
have been one of the King’s agents, the date is probably about the end
of the year 1488. Sir Thomas Brews, the writer’s husband, died in
1482.</p>

[The writer of this letter was Robert Clere of Ormesby, who was knighted
in 1494, and was sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk in 1501. The expression
‘your’ farmer of Mauteby, shows that it was written after the death of
Margaret Paston, and that the Sir John addressed must have been her
second son, to whom the manor of Mauteby descended. The date is,
therefore, not earlier than 1487 when this Sir John was knighted, and

Andrew, the writer of this letter, was a servant of William Paston, the
uncle of Sir John, but the William Paston to whom this letter is
addressed seems to have been Sir John’s brother, whom we find to have
been in service with the Earl of Oxford during the years 1488-90.</p>

Apparently this ‘he’ means Yelverton himself, his servant being at the
time a prisoner in the Earl of Oxford’s custody. Fenn erroneously reads
‘in person’ instead of ‘in preson’ in the previous sentence.</p>

<p><a class = "tag" name = "note115_2" id = "note115_2" href =

Fenn supposes ‘my lady’s grace’ to be the Countess of Richmond, the
King’s mother. I&nbsp;should think, however, it was more probably the
Lady Anne Beaufort, wife of William Paston the uncle, the writer being
in their service.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] This letter
is erroneously dated by Fenn 1487-8. Although Lord Woodville made an
unauthorised expedition into Brittany in the spring of 1488, which is
alluded to in <a href = "#letter1026">No.&nbsp;1026</a>, no succours
were sent by Henry for the relief of the Duchy till after the crushing
defeat of Duke Francis at the battle of St. Aubin (July 28, 1488). The
Duke died on the 9th September following, and his daughter Anne became
Duchess of Brittany. Commissions to raise archers for the relief of
Brittany were issued in December, and musters were commanded to be taken
in February 1489.</p>

[From Fenn, ii. 158.] This letter was unquestionably written in the
reign of Henry <span class = "smallroman">VII.</span>, and not in that
of Edward <span class = "smallroman">IV.</span>, to which Fenn assigned
it. The writer, William Paston, was only born in the year 1459, and was
still pursuing his studies at Eton so late in Edward’s reign as the year
1479, in the end of which year his eldest brother, Sir John Paston,
died. The Sir John Paston to whom this is addressed must therefore be
the second son of John Paston, Esquire, who was knighted at the battle
of Stoke in 1487, and died in 1503. The year in which the letter was
written is, however, still doubtful. I&nbsp;do not find by the Privy
Seal dates of Henry <span class = "smallroman">VII.</span> that such a
progress as is here spoken of was ever carried out. Apparently it was
intended that, beginning on Monday fortnight after the date of the
letter, the King should occupy a fortnight on the way from London to
Norwich, and arrive there on Palm Sunday Eve. The year must therefore
have been one in which Palm Sunday Eve fell between the 5th and the 11th
of April, and Easter Day between the 13th and 19th April. The earliest
year that will suit these conditions is 1489, when Easter fell on the
19th April; and that this was the true date of the letter is made
probable by several other circumstances. In 1489 the King was staying at
Sheen during March. A great council had certainly met in the end of the
year 1488 about the affairs of Brittany, and is very likely to have
prolonged its meetings or renewed them from time to time to the 3rd
March following. Moreover, if our date be correct, it supplies an
interesting and highly probable fact with regard to Henry, Earl of
Northumberland, the fourth of the line of Percy, who was slain in an
insurrection in the north in April following, showing that he was with
the King at Sheen in the beginning of March, and had undertaken by
indenture to protect the Borders against the Scots, not long before he
found himself called upon to put down the King’s rebellious subjects in
Yorkshire.</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 310.] This letter is dated from Heningham, or Hedingham,
one of the places which, as we have seen in <a href =
"#letter1031">No.&nbsp;1031</a>, the King was to have visited on his
intended journey northwards in 1489. I&nbsp;have little doubt,
therefore, that it was written in that year. The writer, according to
Fenn, was William Paston, Sir John’s uncle; but it is remarkable that in
this same year William Paston, Sir John’s brother, writes to him from
Heningham, and as the signatures of the two Williams were not very
unlike each other, one may fairly suspect that Fenn has here made an
error. This suspicion is, moreover, confirmed by the fact that Mautby
was the property of Margaret Paston, who died in 1484, and that it could
not possibly have descended to her brother-in-law William, though her
son William may have had an interest in it.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] It is evident
that this letter was written shortly after the preceding, which is dated
the 6th May. In that letter Paston is desired to be at Cambridge on the
Tuesday following to do the King service, and here we find that it was
intended by the King himself to have been there, leading an army against
some Northern rebels in person. The expressions in the beginning of this
letter leave very little doubt that the insurrection referred to was
that in which the Earl of Northumberland was slain on the 28th April
1489.&mdash;<i>See</i> Leland’s <i>Collectanea</i>, iv. 246.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] This letter
was printed in volume v. of the original edition, p.&nbsp;380. I&nbsp;do
not know Sir John Fenn’s reason for considering it to have been written
‘about 1490,’ but as I see nothing to the contrary, I&nbsp;keep it under
his date. The writer was probably one of the German merchants of the
Hanse, and the name with which he signs the letter seems to have been a
little Anglicised. It is endorsed by Sir John, ‘Lumen Henrikson.’</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] This humorous
petition, though it bears no address, was certainly drawn up for
presentation to Sir John Radcliff, Lord Fitzwalter, the writer of
Letters 1024 and 1025, for he was lord of the manor of Billingford in
Norfolk, and James Radcliff, the farmer of his warren, was evidently his
kinsman. The date is probably, as Fenn suggests, ‘about 1490,’ certainly
before 1495, when Lord Fitzwalter was beheaded. The <span class =

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] Thomas
Howard, Earl of Surrey, the writer of this letter, fought for Richard
<span class = "smallroman">III.</span> at the battle of Bosworth, and
was taken prisoner. He was, however, after some years’ confinement,
liberated from the Tower, and taken into favour. In 1489 the King sent
him into the North to put down the rebellion in which the Earl of
Northumberland was slain, and afterwards made him his lieutenant-general
north of Trent; and for ten years he resided continually in those parts.
The date of this letter, therefore, cannot be earlier than 1490, though
it may be several years later.</p>

ordinances,’ says Fenn, ‘respecting corporation business, made by the
men of Yarmouth, through Sir John Paston and Lord Oxford’s attention to
them, received the King’s assent by his Attorney-General in 1491. It was
for their activity in those matters, I&nbsp;presume, that this letter of

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] The writer of
this letter was the widow of John Mowbray, the last Duke of Norfolk of
that name, who died in 1475. She survived her husband many years, and
Fenn says, though I know not on what authority, that she was alive in
1496. Sir Harry Grey, it appears, made his will on the 28th September
1492 (Blomefield, v. 93), and one might imagine this letter was written
in the same month and year. The inquisition upon his death, however, was
only taken on the 26th October, 12 Hen. <span class =
"smallroman">VII.</span> (1496), and it does not state the day on which
he died. The jurors found Thomas Martyn, who was then thirty years old
and over, to be his kinsman and next heir, but that Ketteringham Hall
was devised to the use of his wife Jane and of others after her death.
It is certain, moreover, that this letter could not have been written
before the year 1495 when Sir Robert Clere was knighted; and that is
probably the very year, as Sir Harry Grey was dead at least in October
1496, and most likely a month or two earlier.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] Fenn says, I
cannot tell on what grounds, that this letter must have been written
between 1491 and 1495. At the earlier of these dates the writer could
not have been more than twelve years old, but as lads were sent to the
university at a much earlier age in those days than in ours, even the
earlier of these dates is not impossible. The style of the letter,
however, is not boyish, and I should have been inclined to place it a
year or two later even than Fenn’s latest date, but that there is no
clear evidence to go by. The sweating sickness was prevalent in England
at different times during the reign of Henry <span class =

the two Sir Johns, died in 1496, and this letter must have been written
either in the year following or between that date and 1503, when Sir
Reginald Bray died. William Paston’s will, which will be found in the
Appendix, was dated 7th September 1496, and proved on the 28th November
following. He married Anne Beaufort, daughter of Edmond, Duke of
Somerset, and was therefore uncle to the writer of this letter,

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] From the
mention of ‘Master Fitzlewes, Knight of Essex,’ I am inclined to think
this letter must be of the reign of Henry <span class =
"smallroman">VII.</span>, and addressed to the later Sir John. Sir Lewis
Fitzlewes of West Horndon, in Essex, was attainted as a Lancastrian in
1471, but the manor was restored to his son, Sir Richard, by Henry <span
class = "smallroman">VII.</span>, who presented to the living from 1494
to 1519. The letter, however, must of course be earlier than 1503, the
year in which Sir John Paston died.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] This letter
is anonymous, but is in the handwriting of Sir John Paston, the younger
of that name. From the mention of his wife and ‘the widow, her daughter
Leghe,’ it was evidently written not during the life of Margery Brews,
his first wife, who must have died about the year 1495, but after his
marriage to another. This second wife was Agnes, daughter of Nicholas
Morley, Esq., of the well-known family at Glynd, in Sussex, and had
already been twice married before her marriage with Sir John. Her first
husband was John Hervey, Esq. of Thurleigh, Beds, Usher of the Chamber
to King Edward <span class = "smallroman">IV.</span> Her second was John
Isley of Sundridge, Kent. By the former she had a daughter, Isabel,
married to John Leghe or Alyghe, Esq. of Addington, Surrey, who proved
his father-in-law’s will in 1494. She herself survived her own third
husband, Sir John Paston, and died in 1510. Her will, in which she calls
herself ‘Dame Agnes Paston,’ is at the principal registry at Somerset
House, dated the 31st May in that year, and proved on the 19th June
following. For these particulars I was indebted to the genealogical
researches of the late Colonel Chester, and <i>Notes and Queries</i>,
5th S. ix. 326, 370, 414, 512.</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 458.] The ‘Black Knight,’ to whom this facetious doggrel
was addressed, seems to me to have been most probably the later Sir John
Paston, whose services the Earl of Oxford, as the reader is aware,
continually made use of. The manor of Knapton came to John, 12th Earl of
Oxford, who died in 1462, by his marriage with Elizabeth, grand-daughter
of Sir John Howard.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] The writer of
this letter was William Warham, who was first Bishop of London, and
afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury. According to the signature, he was
Bishop-elect of London at the time it was written, but we are persuaded
that it is a slip of the pen. He was elected Bishop of London in 1502,
and was consecrated on the 5th October; but it is clear from the
preceding No. that Sir John Paston was alive as late as the beginning of
February 1503. In the year 1503, however, Warham was translated to
Canterbury. The bull for his translation was issued on the 29th November
1503, but doubtless he was elected some time before; and it is quite
intelligible how, being actually Bishop of London, he should have
written ‘Elect of London’ in place of ‘Elect of Canterbury.’ Moreover,
the allusion to the business of the administration agrees entirely with
this supposition.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] If this
petition was addressed to any member of the Paston family, I&nbsp;should
think it must have been William Paston, the son of the later Sir John.
That would make the date at least as late as the year 1503, when his
father died. If it was either of the two Sir Johns, ‘my master your
father’ would be John Paston, Esquire, who died in 1466. But Nicholas
Pickering of Filby is said to have been buried in the steeple of Filby
church in the year 1466, and it is evident that ‘my master your father’
survived him more than nine years.</p>

<p>Edmund Norman, whose executors are here spoken of, died as far back
as 1444. Blomefield says he was seised of two parts of the manor of
Filby, but does not mention him as being also owner of two parts of Holm
Hale. The two parts of Filby were afterwards held in trust by Sir John
Fastolf; but William Pickering and Cecily, his wife, were lords of the
whole manor and settled it on John Paston, who released it to Nicholas
Pickering in 1450.&mdash;Blomefield, xi. 218, 221.</p>
